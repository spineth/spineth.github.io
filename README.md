Spineth is an ethereum based guessing game where two players play head to head in an attempt to win ether from each other. In each game, two players wager an agreed upon amount of ether while each betting on a number of a 19 sector wheel. A winning number is then selected at random. Whichever player is the closest to the winning number will win a portion of their opponent's wager.
