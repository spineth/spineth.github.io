If, for some reason, you do not reveal your bet in time, your opponent can choose to expire the game. This causes you to lose the maximum amount of your bet. The detailed game rules can be found in the How to play section at the bottom of the page.</p><br><h1>Why should I trust Spineth?</h1><br><p>Spineth uses an ethereum smart contract to control interactions between the contract creator and players of the game. The Spineth smart contract does not allow its creator to withdraw any eth from the contract at any time, nor does it allow the creator to destroy the contract and pull out the remaining eth. The only thing the contract creator can do is adjust the min and max bet limits. Your bet can only be won/lost according to the rules of play. We encourage all users to read the Spineth smart contract code. You can find the verified source code on etherscan.io by using the link at the bottom of the Spineth page. When using your ethereum plugin/browser we also encourage you to verify the contract address you are interacting with is the same as the one associated with the verified code on etherscan.io.</p><br><h1>Why doesn't Spineth work with &lt;x&gt;?</h1><br><p>The Spineth site has been tested with Mist, Parity Browser Extension, Metamask (chrome) and Metamask (firefox). If you are having trouble using Spineth with any other ethereum provider, please let us know and we will do our best to add support for it. You can either open a github issue <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spineth/spineth.github.io/issues">here</a> or send us an email at <a href="mailto:spineth.github@gmail.com">spineth.github@gmail.com</a>.</p><br><h1>Why does Metamask show me this message when I try to create a game?</h1><br><p style="color:#f7861c">Signing this message can have dangerous side effects. Only sign messages from sites you fully trust with your entire account. This dangerous method will be removed in a future version. Read more here.</p><br><p>Spineth protects the bet of a game creator from other prospective players by hashing it with a secret value that only the game creator knows. This ensures a joining player can't know the creator's bet until after they have joined the game and committed to a bet of their own. One straight forward way to produce a secret is to have the creator use a passphrase. The main problem with a passphrase is that the creator has to remember it. If it is forgotten, it can never be recovered and the creator will never be able to reveal their bet.</p><br><p>To avoid this problem, Spineth generates secrets a different way. The game creator signs the unique game id associated with the game they are creating using their private key. This data is then hashed to produce a secret. These steps are all performed off chain. This signed data is a secret because it is impossible for anyone else to produce it unless they have the creator's private key. It can also be reproduced at any time by the creator by simply signing the game id again, so the creator doesn't have to remember anything.</p><br><p>But what does any of this have to do with the Metamask warning?</p><br><p>Spineth currently uses the eth_sign method of the ethereum web3 api, because it is the most widely supported method for signing data. The main problem with this signing method is that it is possible for a malicious DApp to have you sign specific data that could result in mathematically revealing parts of your private key. For example, signing "0" data. The concern is that the average user will not understand that signing this kind of data is necessarily bad, so Metamask has opted to show this scary warning to ensure a user will do the research to understand what they are doing. This problem has been widely discussed on various github threads, the most complete discussion can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/683">here</a>.</p><br><p>So we just have to trust that Spineth will not try to reveal our private key?</p><br><p>Spineth will never ask you to sign data that can reveal your private key. You can confirm this by examing the signing code in javascript. It always prepends a string to the game id and hashes the entire string to produce the signing data. Look for this code:</p><br><p><small>window.web3.sha3(window.web3.toHex("Signing Spineth Game ID: " + gameId));</small></p><br><p>In addition to this, the ethereum dev community appears to be close to reaching consensus on a new data signing method. You can read about it <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712">here</a>. Once this method is implemented by the major ethereum web3 providers, Spineth is planning to upgrade to this new method.</p><br><h1>Why am I being prompted for a passphrase when I try to create a game?</h1><br><p>If you are using Mist, there is currently no support for a graphical eth_sign workflow. In this case, Spineth falls back to a passphrase. There is a large amount of discussion around eth_sign and introducing a new signing method to replace it. You can read about the new method <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/pull/712">here</a>. We are hopeful that Mist will support this new signing method once it is released. Once this method is implemented by the major ethereum web3 providers, Spineth is planning to upgrade to this new method.</p><br><h1>What do I do if I find a bug or have an improvement suggestion?</h1><br><p>You can either open an issue on github <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/spineth/spineth.github.io/issues">here</a> or you can send us an email at <a href="mailto:spineth.github@gmail.com">spineth.github@gmail.com</a>.</p><br><h1>How does random number generation work?</h1><br><p>The random number in each game is produced by generating a hash from the wheel bets of the players along with some other game information.
